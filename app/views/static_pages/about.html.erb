			JumpSquares was created because I had a problem. Whenever I logged into a remote locaton, a lab, and even my own environment, I couldn't 
			figure out where anything was. I was constantly sending off emails to see where certain applications were installed, or 
			I was launching the vSphere Client to figure out IP addresses or DNS names of the servers where those applications were hosted.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			So I got the idea to create a landing page. JumpSquares is really a hybrid of a wiki and pinterest. JumpSquares allows any 
			user, developer, engineer, or administrator to access the page to figure out where everything is located. If someone installs 
			a new application, they can create a new JumpSquare so they can let everyone know where the application was installed.
		</p>

		<p>
		We've all been there before when you have zombie applications sprawling out all over the place. JumpSquares makes everyone 
		standardize on a single location as a "master copy" where they can access all web-based applications (and even do some SSH!).
